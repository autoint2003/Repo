https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/budget-2026-debate-fiscal-surplus-global-uncertainties-pap-mps-5949516,"Budget 2026 debate: PAP MPs call for prudence, caution amid global uncertainties",Singapore,Members of Parliament from the People's Action Party also urged for more social support for vulnerable groups in society.,Members of Parliament from the People's Action Party also urged for more social support for vulnerable groups in society.,SINGAPORE,"Members of Parliament from the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) on Tuesday (Feb 24) called for prudence amid global uncertainties, as Singapore recorded a surplus of S$15 billion (US$11.8 billion) for the 2025 financial year. More than 30 MPs spoke in parliament on the first day of the Budget 2026 debate, with some raising suggestions on how the most vulnerable in society can be better supported The surplus for the current financial year is more than double the earlier estimate of S$6.8 billion. A number of PAP MPs opened their speeches by noting heightened global uncertainty due to geopolitical tensions. “The global environment is rapidly evolving. We are witnessing heightened geopolitical rivalry, economic fragmentation and a growing willingness by some states to prioritise what they believe to be national interests over collective commitments,” said MP Vikram Nair (PAP-Sembawang). “While international law remains indispensable, we must also be realistic and prepare for a world in which non-compliance is going to be more common and where major powers may not always abide by either the letter or the spirit of international commitments.” Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said in his Budget speech last Thursday that the stronger economic position was partly driven by better-than-expected economic performance , highlighting the increase in corporate income tax collections. MP Saktiandi Supaat (PAP-Bishan-Toa Payoh) noted that residents had asked him why there were not more ""goodies"" in light of the Budget surplus. ""This is an understandable question, but the surplus reflects, in part, the volatility of the global environment. Unexpected developments, whether geopolitical tensions or trade disruptions, can quickly affect growth and revenue. ""While we performed better than expected in 2025 as our economy grew 5 per cent, beyond our expectations ... we cannot assume that such conditions will persist,"" Mr Saktiandi said. Likewise, MP Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) said that Singapore's prudence was an asset as it gave the country options to act in times of uncertainty. ""In a more dangerous world, fiscal strength is national defence. Our buffers are not excesses. They are strategic insurance,"" he said. Fiscal resilience is strategic capability as it preserves Singapore’s strategic autonomy, said MP Yip Hon Weng. Given its current surplus position, perhaps it can signal stability by avoiding further tax increases in the near term, he said in parliament on Tuesday (Feb 24). Mr Yip noted that the government may need to raise revenue but stressed that revenue adjustments should be designed with cost pressures firmly in mind. Where space exists, it should be used to cushion households and strengthen trust. Trust must also underpin Singapore’s AI transition, he said. If Singapore gets it right, it will not merely adopt AI but will guide, shape and humanise it. The PAP MPs noted that the surplus does not in itself ease the cost-of-living pressures faced by Singaporeans, with some turning to how resources can be better deployed to help individuals cope. Some MPs raised tax-related suggestions. Mr Saktiandi proposed raising the income tax threshold for tax exemptions from the current S$20,000 to S$25,000 or S$30,000, given that median incomes have increased. The median monthly household income in Singapore rose to S$12,446 last year, up from S$11,558 the year before, an increase of 6.8 per cent after adjusting for inflation. ""More low and middle income earners enter the tax base not because they are significantly better off, but because the system has not been recalibrated,"" Mr Saktiandi said, adding that this would provide meaningful relief to low and middle income groups. Parliament on Tuesday (Feb 24) began its debate on Budget 2026 delivered by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. MP Saktiandi Supaat kicked off the debate by expressing support for the Budget and addressed the “life cycle economic security” of Singaporeans. He also touched on the retirement adequacy of Singaporeans and wanted to know the government’s assessment on the success of the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board's Matched Retirement Savings Scheme. He also wanted to know more about the new CPF life-cycle investment products, and asked the CPF Board to provide scenario-based projections to strengthen confidence among Singaporeans so that they can adequately provide for themselves after retirement. Similarly, MP Shawn Loh (PAP-Jalan Besar) said the fiscal surplus should give the government more confidence to assure Singaporeans that it would not take ""major revenue-raising moves"" up to 2035, barring any material adverse circumstances. Nominated MP Terence Ho said that a balance must be struck between setting aside funds for rainy days, investing in infrastructure capabilities and human capital, and strengthening social support. He also suggested reframing the Community Development Council (CDC) vouchers scheme as part of a broader social support framework. Vouchers and credits can be repositioned as a social dividend, an annual sum given to citizens that signifies that they have a stake in the country and its collective wealth, said Assoc Prof Ho. ""The government can determine the size of the dividend it declares each year, depending on prevailing fiscal and economic conditions,"" he said. ""The dividend should be universal and progressive, meaning that everyone receives something, or the less well off receive more. A social dividend would be a form of social support that complements the structural transfers, is flexible in size and sends a clear message of solidarity and inclusion."" Some of the MPs also urged stronger support for families and vulnerable groups. MP David Hoe (PAP-Jurong East-Bukit Batok) asked for support for parents in the form of housing, reduced transport-related stress and childcare leave. To support large families, the government should make it easier for those planning to have more children to secure homes of an adequate size, Mr Hoe said. He suggested introducing larger “jumbo Build-to-Order” flats designed for modern families, including space for domestic helpers. These flats could be priced similarly to smaller units through additional subsidies, but with conditions — such as requiring couples to commit to having two or more children within five to seven years of the minimum occupation period. If they do not meet the condition, a clear downsizing pathway with subsidy clawbacks would apply, while allowing for reasonable exceptions such as medical fertility issues. Singapore’s total fertility rate, which was at a historical low of 0.97 in 2024, suggests that Singapore has not been successful in shifting the needle on encouraging Singaporeans to have children, said MP David Hoe in parliament on Tuesday (Feb 24). He proposed a shift from “doing more in an aggregate manner, to doing better”, addressing the concerns of adequate space in HDB flats, mobility and commuting stress, paid childcare leave and accessibility to play areas for children. He also raised the issue of a widening opportunity gap and equitable access to opportunities among families with children. He also suggested keeping childcare leave provision under periodic review. Currently, parents get six days of paid childcare leave per child when their child is six years or younger. When the child is aged between seven and 12, the parent gets two days a year. Mr Hoe said that when a child turned seven, the government could still keep the number of childcare leave to six days a year and taper off the number of leave days, so it is not a sharp drop. MP Jackson Lam (PAP-Nee Soon) called for better support for seniors who are healthy and willing to continue working. He proposed piloting structured second-career pathways in sectors with strong labour demand and combining modular training, job redesign and clear job placements for workers aged 55 and above. Job-specific digital skills modules and a clearly identified senior skills track could lower barriers to participation, he added. ""Ultimately, supporting seniors is not just about financial adequacy. It is about dignity, contribution and about sustaining intergenerational trust, and that trust strengthens us, especially in uncertain times.""",,Singapore,2026-02-25T00:16:23.854013
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/fedex-sues-us-refund-trumps-emergency-tariffs-5949311,FedEx sues US for refund on Trump's emergency tariffs,World,More than US$175 billion in tariff collections are subject to potential refunds after the US Supreme Court deemed Donald Trump's emergency tariffs illegal.,More than US$175 billion in tariff collections are subject to potential refunds after the US Supreme Court deemed Donald Trump's emergency tariffs illegal.,LOS ANGELES,"Global transportation company FedEx on Monday (Feb 23) filed a lawsuit in the United States Court of International Trade seeking a refund for President Donald Trump's emergency tariffs, one of the highest profile moves to recover funds since the US Supreme Court last week deemed the tariffs illegal . A flood of lawsuits to recover billions of dollars is expected by trade attorneys after the blockbuster ruling. The recovery process still has to be worked out by a lower court, however, complicating the matter. More than US$175 billion in US tariff collections are subject to potential refunds after the US Supreme Court last Friday ruled 6-3 that Trump overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a sanctions law, to impose tariffs on imported goods, Penn-Wharton Budget Model economists said. ""Plaintiffs seek for themselves a full refund from defendants of all IEEPA duties plaintiffs have paid to the United States,"" FedEx said in the lawsuit, referring to tariffs Trump imposed. FedEx and its logistics arm served as the importer of record on goods subject to IEEPA tariffs. The Memphis-based company did not provide the dollar value of the refund it is seeking. FedEx, in its lawsuit, named US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the agency's commissioner Rodney Scott and the United States of America as defendants. CBP and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Washington-based Crowell & Moring is representing FedEx in the lawsuit and referred Reuters to the company, which did not immediately comment. Crowell & Moring also represents discount club retailer Costco, cosmetics firm Revlon, eyewear seller EssilorLuxottica and other companies in IEEPA tariff refund cases. Importers, distributors and suppliers appear to be best placed to win IEEPA tariff refunds because their paperwork likely will include customs documents or invoices with line-item breakdowns of tariff costs tied to specific goods, said Ron Ciotti, a partner at the law firm Hinckley Allen in Boston, who represents construction contractors and developers across the United States. ""If there was a tariff escalation in your contract or a price adjustment clause based on tariffs, and that's why the price went up, if you had a contract that stated that, then you might be able to get a refund,"" Ciotti said. California Governor Gavin Newsom, seen as a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2028, separately demanded tariff refund checks for Americans after they were struck down by the Supreme Court. ""I've heard some (people) saying this is such a win for the consumer, because they should get refunds back on certain products that would have been under tariffs,"" said Ciotti. ""I don't see how they can,"" he said, adding that many businesses and consumers paid higher prices for goods without any written explanation about how tariffs contributed to higher prices and may lack the proof needed to win a refund.",,World,2026-02-25T00:16:28.182244

They have also been requested to increase their patrols and drone surveillance, including for the forested areas behind the houses, Member of Parliament (MP) for Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC Chee Hong Tat said on Tuesday (Feb 24). These measures come after two break-ins were reported last week. Preliminary investigations revealed that an individual allegedly entered a residence without permission and left before the police arrived. The second incident involved a residence along Marigold Drive. Police were called to the scene on the night of Feb 21. ""Upon arrival, officers established that an individual had allegedly entered a residential premises without permission and had left prior to police arrival,"" the police said in response to CNA's queries. Police investigations into both cases are ongoing and efforts to trace the suspects are underway. Mr Chee said residents have also formed community watch groups to raise awareness and vigilance, and to look out for one another. ""I thank our police officers for stepping up their presence in the neighbourhood."" The person left prior to the police's arrival and the authorities are in the midst of establishing the person's identity. Members of the public with information relating to the incidents are advised to contact the police hotline at 1800-255-0000 or submit information online . All information received will be kept strictly confidential, said the police, adding residents are advised to remain vigilant and report any suspicious people or activities immediately. The police also advised the public to call “999” immediately if they see any persons behaving suspiciously in their neighbourhood.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pritam-singh-workers-party-full-disclosure-public-spending-5948876,Budget 2026 debate: Pritam Singh calls for full disclosure of billions in public spending amid record surplus,Singapore,The Workers’ Party chief says the public deserves detailed “report cards” on how taxpayer funds are used.,The Workers’ Party chief says the public deserves detailed “report cards” on how taxpayer funds are used.,SINGAPORE,"Workers’ Party chief Pritam Singh has called for greater public disclosure of billions of dollars in government spending, pressing for clearer accountability at a time he described as “one of the largest fiscal surpluses in decades”. Speaking in parliament on Tuesday (Feb 24) at the start of the Budget debate, Mr Singh also took aim at the timing of the last General Election, saying it was called shortly after global trade tensions flared. “The PAP (People's Action Party) government dissolved parliament just days after the Trump administration's announcement,” he said, referring to the so-called Liberation Day tariffs unveiled by the United States last year. “The political timing of the general elections was calculated to put the PAP in the most advantageous position, with tariff uncertainty serving as a rallying call for voters to back the tried and tested,"" he said. “Since then, however, there has been remarkably little information on the sectoral tariffs and their actual impact on Singapore.” Despite the “doom and gloom” surrounding the tariffs then, Mr Singh noted that the government now begins its new term “with what may be the greatest fiscal surplus any PAP government has seen in decades”. Singapore recorded a surplus of S$15 billion (US$11.8 billion) for the 2025 financial year and expects an S$8 billion surplus for the 2026 financial year – figures Mr Singh said already far exceed the S$2 billion to S$3 billion in additional annual revenue that the Goods and Services Tax (GST) hikes of 2023 and 2024 were meant to generate. Corporate tax collections are also expected to rise from the 2027 financial year, potentially widening the surplus further. Against this backdrop, Mr Singh said “significant” public interest surrounds how these surpluses get deployed, particularly as Singapore grapples with an ageing population and persistent inequality. Pointing to the S$40 billion Forward Singapore package announced during Budget 2024, he said: “To my knowledge, there has been no well-publicised tracking of cumulative spending since then.” On the Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2030 plan – for which funding has increased to S$37 billion – Mr Singh said “no comprehensive report” existed on how previous allocations were used or what outcomes were achieved. “There is much work still to be done in demonstrating how efficaciously taxpayer dollars have been spent. Across most Budgets, there is a lack of easy-to-track outcomes on the headlines that have been announced.” He said the government should be mindful of the “public cynicism and detachment” that can grow when Singaporeans do not see a clear accounting of how public funds are used. “That is not good for Singapore, and it sits in contradiction with the participatory spirit that Forward Singapore was meant to embody,” he said. The time has come to refine the CDC Vouchers Scheme to better help Singaporean families, said MP Pritam Singh. He proposed a “simple and targeted adjustment” - retain the S$500 base for all households of three members or fewer. For owner-occupied households with more than three members, provide an additional S$150 per person. This is a modest and practical refinement that better reflects the actual cost-of-living burden that larger families carry, he said. It was among the suggestions he proposed in parliament on Tuesday (Feb 24), as he stressed that “taking care of our own” represents one standard by which all government policies will be unpacked, measured and scrutinised by the Workers’ Party. MP Gerald Giam (WP-Aljunied) pressed further on the government's fiscal projections, and what he described as a “recurring pattern of overly conservative” forecasts. The revised FY2025 surplus of S$15.1 billion is more than double the original estimate of S$6.8 billion – a discrepancy Mr Giam said was not an isolated incident but part of a consistent trend in which ""projected deficits regularly transform into healthy surpluses"". “While the government points to the volatility of tax revenue, this consistent underestimation raises fundamental questions of … whether the government is unnecessarily hoarding funds,"" he said. “We need more accurate forecasting that ensures our nation's abundance benefits current generations as much as future generations.” Mr Giam also questioned the necessity of the GST hike, which was supposed to fund increased healthcare costs, since surpluses had exceeded S$1 billion in all but one of the last five years, with a total of S$22 billion. He pointed out that the Ministry of Health's revised operating expenditure for FY2025 came in S$305 million lower than estimated, due to lower-than-projected funding needs for public healthcare institutions, and asked whether the government would revise its projections for future healthcare expenditure growth. He also flagged a sharp rise in revenue from licences and permits, which surged by 29 per cent to reach S$9.23 billion in revised FY2025 figures, and sought clarification on what drove the increase. “True prudence is not just about amassing vast fiscal buffers. It's about balancing future security with the current needs of our people,” he said. “Unnecessary taxation drains liquidity from households up front, creating a dependency on government handouts rather than fostering genuine financial independence.” Mr Singh raised questions about whether the formula used to determine ministers’ bonuses remains appropriate, in light of Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong’s earlier remarks that GDP growth may no longer translate into jobs for Singaporeans . During a mid-term update for the Economic Strategy Review last month, Mr Gan said that economic growth may not automatically lead to job creation given technological advancements, and Singapore needs to be ""deliberate"" about its policies and strategies. Mr Singh said those remarks placed ""every job-related policy, initiative and scheme"" announced by the government into “sharper perspective than ever before”. “For each – more so than before – Singaporeans deserve a well-publicised and detailed report card, one that distinguishes rhetoric about promises kept with measurable outcomes subject to parliamentary and public scrutiny,” he said. He also questioned whether GDP growth should continue to factor into the national bonus for ministers. ""If GDP growth will no longer reliably create good jobs for Singaporeans, should it remain in the ministerial bonus formula at all?"" he asked. He proposed anchoring the national bonus to a single objective outcome: ""good jobs for Singaporeans in the age of artificial intelligence"". On Community Development Council (CDC) vouchers, Mr Singh noted the scheme's growth since its introduction at S$100 per household, but argued the current flat distribution model is inequitable. “A household of two individuals receives the same as a household of five,” he said. He proposed retaining the S$500 base for households of three or fewer, but providing an additional S$150 per person for larger owner-occupied households. “This is a modest and practical refinement, one that better reflects the actual cost-of-living burden larger families carry,” he said. He also welcomed the increase in the monthly household income threshold for student care subsidies to S$6,500, but urged a broader review of the subsidy calculation framework. On defence spending, Mr Singh reiterated the WP’s support for the government’s priorities. “As in previous Budgets, Singaporeans will know there is non-partisan support for the defence-related priorities in this Budget,” he said. “That consensus remains clear, and it holds.” At the same time, he called for greater engagement with Singaporeans, new immigrants and citizens about the country’s national interests, amid a shifting geopolitical environment. “Without that, the phrase national interest risks becoming a shorthand to shut down a conversation rather than to start one,” he said. With Singapore's growing immigrant population, he said building psychological defence resilience has become ""more urgent than ever"". Despite his concerns, Mr Singh ended his speech by expressing support for the Budget, while reiterating the Workers’ Party’s call for greater accountability. “This Budget was delivered against a backdrop of genuine uncertainty, a shifting global order, the disruption of AI and the anxieties of working Singaporeans who worry about whether their wages, their savings and their children's future will keep up,” he said. “In this context, taking care of our own represents one standard by which all government policies will be unpacked, measured and scrutinised by the Workers' Party in this term of government,” he said. MP Dennis Tan (WP-Hougang) and Non-Constituency MP Eileen Chong also spoke during Tuesday's debate. Ms Chong focused on family support policies, calling for expanded childcare leave on a per-child basis, paid caregiving leave and ""actual and enforceable"" flexible work arrangement policies rather than guidelines – steps she said could support higher fertility and stronger family outcomes. Mr Tan renewed his call for dental care to be integrated into Healthier SG, and urged the government to harmonise subsidies so seniors are not penalised financially when dental needs require hospital-based treatment. ""We must treat oral health as a basic pillar of well-being, not an optional extra,"" he said. Mr Tan also raised concerns about integrated shield plan premiums rising when new rules take effect in April 2026, warning that higher costs could drive patients away from private healthcare and overwhelm the public system.",,Singapore,2026-02-25T00:16:32.642735

MPs on both sides of the House supported the artificial intelligence focus of the Budget unveiled by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Feb 12, but warned of potential hurdles in embarking on this national strategy. Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister, announced that he will chair a new National AI Council to drive Singapore’s AI agenda. ""Trust is intangible, yet it behaves like infrastructure,"" said Mr Victor Lye (PAP-Ang Mo Kio). ""Trust enables flows, capital, data, talent, goods, decisions. Trust increases resilience to shocks. Trust is the reliability premium that allows counterparties to transact, coordinate and commit to actions at scale."" He called for the government to create trust infrastructure such as regulatory sandboxes and Singapore-verified credentials that would allow foreign companies and professionals to demonstrate compliance skills and experience. Mr Henry Kwek (PAP-Kebun Baru) called trust ""the most precious commodity in the digital economy"", noting that businesses will locate their AI operations where they have confidence in the legal system and the government behind it. ""Singapore has spent decades building exactly that trust,"" he said. Ms Mariam Jaafar (PAP-Sembawang) said this reputation allows Singapore to overcome its lack of natural resources, limited land space and shrinking labour force. ""We do not compete on scale and spend. We compete on coordination, trust, governance and execution,"" she said. Singapore can build ""the most trusted agentic systems and applications"", creating AI that is safe, accountable and designed for real industries, she added. Minister of State for Digital Development and Information and for Education Jasmin Lau said that human accountability must remain central to AI governance. While AI can process and generate, it cannot be held responsible nor own the consequences of its actions, she said. ""We will still need humans for ethics, for creativity and imagination, and for the ability to look someone else in the eye and say, ‘I take responsibility for this’.” MPs also highlighted the importance of ensuring that small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) are not left behind in AI adoption. They pointed out that while many of these businesses are open to adopting AI, they face structural gaps and uncertainty. Ms Lau noted that many SMEs have raised concerns that they cannot afford to be “guinea pigs” in AI adoption. “They have many personal experiences of trying out new technologies and then realising that the technologies became outdated too fast, and they are right to be cautious,” she said. As such, the government will create lower-risk and structured ways for SMEs to experiment, she said, adding that the government is refining its funding scheme. Initially, the barrier was set-up costs, which are already subsidised. Now, the barrier is capability and workflow redesign. Funding support will hence shift accordingly towards implementation, business process redesign, rescaling, and the “much harder work” of changing how an organisation actually operates, she said. “We will make sure we are accountable, but we must also make sure that our SMEs – most of whom are genuine and often already tight on resources – we must make sure they do not get turned away too early by onerous and cumbersome paperwork,” she said. Nominated MP Mark Lee said that SMEs may lack the capacity for AI integration. AI implementation is expensive, and costs include software, data restructuring and upskilling workers, among others, he said. “Big firms have both the talent and financial muscle to spread this fixed cost. SMEs often cannot – if transformation succeeds, gains are gradual. If it fails, losses are immediate.” He added that support for AI adoption must hinge on clarity, or SMEs may misjudge eligibility or misallocate resources. MP Denise Phua (PAP-Jalan Besar) agreed that SMEs cannot be an “afterthought”. “AI is at the centre of our strategy, but on the ground, many business owners are still unsure what this means for survival, not just growth,” she said. She proposed providing precision support to them, rather than broad measures. This includes classifying firms into foundational, emerging or advanced stages of AI-readiness, so that support can be tailored to readiness. Ms Phua also suggested the provision of government-funded AI coaches, and the strengthening of intermediaries, such as the Singapore Business Federation, the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and SME Centres. “The goal is not to push every SME into complex AI systems overnight. The goal is disciplined, intentional transformation. If we get this right, AI becomes a renewal engine for SMEs. If we get it wrong, then we create a two-speed economy, not because help was absent, but because execution lacked precision,” she said. Beyond small businesses, MPs stressed that Singapore’s push for AI should be inclusive to individuals from different backgrounds. To ensure an inclusive social compact, blue-collar workers in manufacturing and logistics could use “physical AI”, said Mr Gerald Giam (WP-Aljunied). Examples include using collaborative robots to assist with heavy lifting in factories or employing AI as a translation tool for workers who struggle with English. “AI should be an equaliser that elevates technical mastery, not a wedge that separates our workforce,” he said. Mr Giam also proposed that the 400 per cent tax deductions on AI expenses should cover corporate AI subscriptions, to give workers access to corporate AI tools while keeping company data secure. “Giving every worker a digital assistant should be a baseline goal for a nation that aspires to be an AI leader. This ensures that the benefits of the technology are shared by the employee and the employer alike,” he said. Ensuring equitable access to AI starts early, noted Mr Darryl David (PAP-Ang Mo Kio). “Before we can talk about mastering AI software and advanced tools, we must ensure that every student starts from the same baseline. AI readiness depends on digital readiness,” he said. Advocating for personal learning devices to be extended to primary school students, he added that without reliable access to personal computing devices, students cannot develop foundational skills or experiment with digital tools in ways that will enable meaningful engagement with AI later. In her speech, Ms Lau also said that the continued evolution of AI will call for a review of ""what education means for our children"". ""AI will force us to sharpen the focus of education on what truly matters – judgment, values and the ability to work with AI, rather than to compete with it,” she said. ""How do we teach our children about AI, in particular, its limits, biases and blind spots? How do we balance the weightage of our education to emphasise character and social development?” MPs highlighted the understanding and awareness gap among workers when it comes to adopting AI and tapping the opportunities that come with it. ""More than three years after ChatGPT changed the world, AI remains an enigma for much of our workforce and many of our businesses,"" noted Workers' Party secretary-general Pritam Singh (WP-Aljunied). He said he looked forward to seeing the “actionable strategies” from the government, calling for clear criteria and standards before AI-related subsidies and grants are disbursed. ""AI-related grants and subsidies must be ringfenced for truly transformative productivity gains so that these taxpayer subsidies are not gamed or abused,"" he said, citing past lapses under the Productivity and Innovation Credit scheme. “We cannot repeat that mistake with taxpayer money with this latest productivity push through AI-related subsidies,” he added. In emerging industries such as AI, quantum, advanced manufacturing and biomedical sciences, many people opt out early simply because they lack exposure, noted Mr David Hoe (PAP-Jurong East-Bukit Batok). ""They do not know what the work actually looks like, what the entry routes are, or what skills matter,"" he said. ""Those with stronger networks can ask someone, get an introduction, or hear early about internships and externships. Those without networks often find out late, or not at all."" The new statutory board created from the merger of Workforce Singapore and SkillsFuture Singapore would hopefully help students and workers without strong industry networks overcome this hidden disadvantage, he said. Mr Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) noted that the recent AI coding revolution does not stop at engineers and programmers, but has implications for other knowledge workers. He called for clearly measurable labour outcomes, with KPIs that are ""explicitly job linked"" published annually. These could include the net number of new roles created, the wage uplift achieved and the time taken for workers' redeployment, said Mr Yip.",,Singapore,2026-02-25T00:16:34.857963
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/measles-infant-preschool-child-vaccination-mmr-cda-5948986,Singapore confirms measles case in 11-month-old girl; first involving child in preschool since stepped-up measures,Singapore,,,SINGAPORE,"Singapore has recorded its first case of measles involving a child attending preschool since the Communicable Diseases Agency (CDA) stepped up measures to better contain and manage measles infection. The agency was notified of the case, involving an 11-month-old female infant, on Feb 17. The child attends a preschool in Singapore and was not yet due for the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination. She has no known recent travel or contact history and is recovering well. “She was in school during her infectious period. Affected parents whose children had been in close contact with the case have been notified by the preschool. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing,”  the agency said. CDA added that among the identified close contacts, all except four were up to date with their measles vaccination or were in the process of getting vaccinated against measles, and no quarantine orders were issued to them. The remaining four were issued quarantine orders. Upon receiving vaccination or post-exposure actions were taken to prevent the disease, their quarantine orders were no longer in force. ""We have advised identified vaccinated close contacts to monitor their health and seek medical care if symptoms develop,"" the agency said. ""Casual, non-close contacts will also be advised to check their vaccination status, monitor their health and seek medical care if symptoms develop."" The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) said on Tuesday that it was aware of the case and was working with CDA and the preschool's operator to ensure the well-being of the remaining enrolled children and staff members. ""ECDA has also reminded the operator to ensure compliance with infection prevention and control measures."" All preschools are required to comply with the health and hygiene requirements stipulated in the Early Childhood Development Centres Regulations and Code of Practice. This includes ensuring that enrolled children and staff members are immunised against measles in accordance with the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule. Operators must verify their workers' documentary proof of measles vaccination or immunity before employment. Singapore introduced measures such as mandatory isolation for measles cases , contact tracing and quarantine of some close contacts in early February, after detecting a rise in infections. Vaccination is the best way to prevent measles infection, CDA said on Tuesday, adding that 87 per cent of measles cases recorded here this year occurred in people who were not fully vaccinated. ""The MMR vaccine is highly effective and safe, and confers long-term immunity after completion of the recommended doses,"" it added. ""High vaccination coverage not only protects individuals but creates herd immunity within the Singapore population that protects those who are unable to receive vaccination, such as infants under 12 months and severely immunocompromised individuals."" As part of regular health surveillance protocols, Singapore's preschools conduct daily temperature and health checks on all children, staff members and visitors upon arrival, ECDA said. "" Any individual who is unwell or displays symptoms of infectious diseases cannot be admitted to the preschool.""

PN’s main components are Bersatu and PAS, while minority-centric parties Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia and the Malaysian Indian People’s Party (MIPP) are considered minor players.
